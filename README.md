# Gcpdashboard
This project involves the design and implementation of a web-based portal that allows users to securely upload files (such as CSV, Excel, or other data formats) directly to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. Once uploaded, these files are processed and stored for further data analysis and visualization.
